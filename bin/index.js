**                   **** Make React Component **** 
* mkRComponent is a utility cli application which allows the developer to 
* create a React Component and its associated files, such as:
*    -[JSX/TSX] [Class/Function] Component
*    -Component's Stylesheet
*    -Component's Test File
*    -Component's Story 
*    -Component's Readme
*
* These are files that are made can be specified by the developer to select 
* which files they wish to make, through the initial setup. Where it would ask 
* a series of questions to generate a configuration file. 'mkR.config.js' which * can be later altered by the developer, either directly or by re-running the 
* initialisation setup (mkRComp init). This would then inform the utility 
* application of the new component requirements of the developer. 
*
* The Output of the utility application are prefabricated files that are 
* produced with the relevant Component Name and links to its accompanying 
* documents. along with the standard file setup with imports and simple body 
* content that lets you quickly dive in and get going.
* 
* The purpose of this utility application is to save some developer burden when * creating or setting up a new React Component. By prefabricating templates
* with the necessary component structures, would save you the developer the
* most precious commodity of all...your time.
* 
* If you have any problems or issues you you can message me directly. ðŸ––
